Official RSG website built in React, Next.js, TypeScript and love <3

This is an ongoing complete rewrite of the original website to be cleaner, up-to-date, WAY more lightweight and with a much better design. Have you looked at the libraries/frameworks/dependencies the old one used to have? A perfect example of overengineering and caused a ton of troubles when updating the website, hence the rewrite. We managed to fix it somewhat by removing a bunch of dependencies, but it's still broken patchwork. A rewrite is way easier than maintaining the old codebase.

## Usage

Use `yarn dev`/`npm run dev` to start up the project in development mode. For production builds, run the build script and then run `yarn start`/`npm start` to start the website in production mode.
